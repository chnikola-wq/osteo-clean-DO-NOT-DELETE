// Tiny plugin that prepends the license banner to every emitted JS
// chunk AFTER esbuild's minifier has run. We can't rely on Rollup's
// `output.banner` alone because Vite runs esbuild minification on the
// whole rendered chunk (banner included), and esbuild hoists its own
// helper `var` declarations to the very top of the file — which pushes
// the banner ~400 bytes down. Doing the prepend in `generateBundle`
// runs after minification, so the banner lands as the first bytes.
